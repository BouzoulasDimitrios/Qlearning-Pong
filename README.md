# Implementation of Qleaning for Pong using C++

# Abstract

This is an implementation of a qlearning algorithm for the classic game of pong.<br> 
In this implementation standard c++ libraries are used in order to implement qlearning.<br> 
No external machine learning libraries are used as the implementation does not involve a neural network.<br> 
In this implementation a look up table is used which represents <br> 
the states of the game along side with the action that can be taken.<br>
